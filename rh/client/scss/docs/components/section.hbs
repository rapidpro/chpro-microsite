        UNICEF also organized community building activities, including two RapidPro developer convening events in 2015 and 2016. These were primarily to introduce the developer community to the technical evolution of RapidProâ€™s architecture, and to promote a competitive, geographically diverse vendor ecosystem to ensure best-value and sustainability for UNICEF and partner governments managing or considering RapidPro-based tools.
